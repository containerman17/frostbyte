#
# Percona Server with MyRocks Configuration (Corrected)
# ----------------------------------------------------
# Focus: High on-disk compression with good performance (~80% compression / 20% speed).
# Environment: Development / Secondary Data Warehouse
# Safety: Tolerant to a few minutes of data loss on crash, but requires transaction atomicity.
#

[mysqld]
# --- User Provided Basics ---
# Set RocksDB as the default engine for all new tables.
default-storage-engine = ROCKSDB
default-tmp-storage-engine = ROCKSDB


# Disable binary logging. This is typical for a standalone data warehouse
# that is not a replication source. It also provides a small performance boost.
disable_log_bin

# Maximum number of concurrent connections.
max_connections = 8000


# --- Data Safety & Performance Tuning ---
# This is the key setting for your performance vs. safety trade-off.
# 1 (Default): fsync WAL on every transaction commit. Fully ACID and durable, but slower.
# 0: Do not fsync WAL on transaction commit. The OS will flush writes to disk periodically.
# This provides a massive performance boost at the risk of losing the last few seconds/minutes
# of transactions if the server crashes (e.g., power loss).
# Given your 5-minute data loss tolerance, this is the most effective setting.
# Transactions written to the WAL but not yet synced to disk will be lost, but any
# transaction that is recovered will be fully atomic (all-or-nothing).
rocksdb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 0


# --- Memory Allocation (Targeting ~2GB for DB Caches) ---
# Main cache for data blocks, indexes, and bloom filters.
# Default is 512M. We'll give it the bulk of our memory budget.
rocksdb_block_cache_size = 1536M

# Total size for all memtables (in-memory write buffers). When this limit is reached,
# the largest memtable is flushed to disk. A larger buffer absorbs more
# writes before forcing a flush, which can smooth out write performance.
rocksdb_db_write_buffer_size = 512M


# --- Compression and On-Disk Compactness (Corrected Syntax) ---
# This is the most important setting for on-disk size. We modify the default
# options to switch from LZ4 to ZSTD compression for a much better compression ratio.
# The invalid "compression_options" parameter has been removed. This will use the
# default ZSTD compression level, which is a good balance of speed and size.
rocksdb_default_cf_options = "block_based_table_factory={cache_index_and_filter_blocks=1;filter_policy=bloomfilter:10:false;whole_key_filtering=1};level_compaction_dynamic_level_bytes=true;optimize_filters_for_hits=true;compaction_pri=kMinOverlappingRatio;compression=kZSTD;bottommost_compression=kZSTD"


# --- Background Operations & Aggressive Maintenance ---
# Sets the total number of concurrent background threads for flushes and compactions.
# The default of 2 can be a bottleneck under heavy write load. Increasing this to 4
# allows MyRocks to keep up with background work, preventing write stalls.
rocksdb_max_background_jobs = 4

# Recalculate optimizer statistics more frequently.
# The default is 3600s (1 hour). For a data warehouse where data profiles
# can change, recalculating every 600s (10 minutes) provides a more up-to-date
# basis for the query planner, leading to better query performance.
rocksdb_seconds_between_stat_computes = 600
